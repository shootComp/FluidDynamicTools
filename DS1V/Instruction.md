## Note
1. If the code crashes and throws error "Segmentation Fault", it is likely due to the overflow of stack. You may need to set `export OMP_STACKSIZE=256M` or even larger

## 0DRate calculation

1. Set the following flags
    - IREAC = 2
    - IRELAX = 0
    - IMFS = 1 if you use MF-DSMC model
2. Create `DS1VD.in` and `input.txt` like the ones in folder `Example/0DRate`. Remember to change `IRM` to match the reaction you want as well as the appropriate mole fraction of the species

## 0DRelax calculation
1. Set the following flags
    - IREAC = 0
    - IRELAX = 0
2. Create `DS1VD.in` and `input.txt` like the ones in folder `Example/0DRelax`. `IRM` has to be `0` to turn off all reactions
3. Track `RELAX.TXT`, it should contain information needed


## 1D Shock
1. Set the following flags
    - IREAC = 0
    - IRELAX = 1

2. Perform following runs:
    1. Unsteady run-start
        - Use code `DS1_openmp_reac_product.f90`, start the code with `run_ds1v.sh`. This code runs will run with input `input3-10_unsteady_start.txt` and will hit `run_multiple_cases.sh`
        - Once the script is hit, a new run will start. The input is generated by `run_multiple_cases.sh`. It should be similar to `input2_multiple_run.txt`. It tell the code continue to run and not to remove molecules. The new run continues until the shock reach the center of domain or some specific locations you set in the code.
    2. Unsteady run:
        - Once the previous runs stop, use the same code as the before, but this time use input file `input2shock_unsteady.txt`. This turns the removal of molecules on. Use `ShockMovie.lay` to track, as well as `RunningTime.TXT`. These files tell you whether you can start a steady state sampling
    3. Trick restart:
        - Once the previous is finished, find out cells you want to sample vibrational energy distribution functions and modify corresponding values in `input2_trick_restart.txt`. Use this as the input for `DS1_openmp_reac_trickrestart.f90`. This code read  previous restart file and generate a new restart file with appropriate memory allocation
    4. Sample shock:
        - Now, use `DS1_openmp_reac_sample.f90`, modify the `NSCELLS` and `NSVELS` at the beginning of the code to match your input for previous run. And sample the shock.
